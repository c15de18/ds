Observations:
- In general, females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
- Median age of survivors (both males and females) is slightly lower than non-survivors.
- There are younger survivors among both genders (some very young children survived).
- Among males, a lot of non-survivors were in the age range 20-40.
- Among females, survivors are spread across a wider age range.
- Outliers are seen in both male and female age distributions.
